#Constraints
- No named abstractions (i.e. no methods/functions)
- No, or little, use of libraries
 

The first constraint meant that we canâ€™t break up the logic into smaller functions, hence why everything is inside one big for loop.

I have seen that this approach doesn't work well for big projects, and it's hard to understand as all is written in one block without dividing it into blocks !
