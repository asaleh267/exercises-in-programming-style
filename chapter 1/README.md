## Chapter 1 

### Constraints
Very small amount of primary memory, typically orders of magnitude smaller than the data that needs to be processed/generated.
No identifiers â€“ i.e. no variable names or tagged memory addresses. All we have is memory that is addressable with numbers.

### Exercises
1.1 Another language. Implement the example program in another language, but preserve the style.

1.2 No identifiers. The example program still has a few identifiers left, namely in lines #60 (c), #116 (i) and #122 (tf). Change the program so that these identifiers are also eliminated.

1.3 More lines. The example program reads one line at a time into memory. In doing so it is underutilizing the main memory. Modify the program so that it loads as many lines as possible into memory without going over the established limit of 1024 memory cells. Justify the number of lines you chose. Check if your version runs faster than the original example program, and explain the result.

1.4 A different task. Write one of the tasks proposed in the Prologue using the Good Old Times style.
